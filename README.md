- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Andy, a Blockchain enthusiast that got hooked up in this field for its unlimited potential to change the world and make it a more transparent and fair space.
- I'm building my own projects to both help grow community of devs at @Movinian and incubate their idea via Global Impact with the Incubator as A Service model (nothing is publish yet cuz we are building our track records with @protonsale_apt and @kanalabs
- I'm currently expanding my network to more investors of all types so if you're an investor and are interested in what I'm building, reach me out at @andy_crpt or anhduy.workingspace@gmail.com and we could discuss further on any verticles.
